🌤️ Live Weather & AQI Forecasting Dashboard – Power BI

A fully dynamic Power BI dashboard that integrates live weather API data and custom AQI visualizations to provide real-time environmental insights, forecasting, and trend analysis.

📌 Project Overview

This Power BI project connects directly to a Weather API to fetch live meteorological data including temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, and Air Quality Index (AQI). The dashboard updates automatically based on API refresh schedules, allowing users to monitor real-time conditions and analyze historical + forecasted weather trends.

The combination of live API integration, DAX-based forecasting, and custom AQI visuals makes this dashboard a professional-grade model for environmental analytics.
